        <h2 class="copy-header">The Problem</h2>
        <p class="copy-text">Cities around the globe are facing stormwater crises. In a rainstorm, most natural landscapes
          can absorb large volumes of water like a sponge, then very slowly release that water to plants,
          streams, and groundwater. In cities, water behaves like commuters at rush hour, creating traffic
          jams in a “gray” infrastructure of pipes, leading to sewer overflows, floods, property damage,
          and water pollution.
          <br>
          <br>
          A solution is “green” stormwater infrastructure, which uses processes inspired by nature to slow,
          clean, and retain water before it reaches the storm drain.
          <br>
          <br>
          But performance data on green infrastructure often is limited, difficult to verify, and/or
          incompatible with stormwater engineering approaches. Without good data, green infrastructure
          is often not utilized, or may be utilized with unknown effectiveness.</p>

        <h2 class="copy-header">What We Do</h2>
        <p class="copy-text">We create scientific testing protocols to assess green infrastructure performance in controlled laboratory environments and in uncontrolled environments.  We utilize these protocols to produce meaningful stormwater management engineering data.
          <br>
          <br>
          We use this data in predictive modeling to evaluate the performance of different green and gray stormwater infrastructure options.  This modeling is a tool for engineers, architects, and regulators in designing highly effective stormwater management solutions.
          <br>
          <br>
          We test and evaluate green infrastructure solutions from a wide range of manufacturer’s product lines, as well as hypothetical products that may be in development, and individual components and processes, such as interaction of a specific type of compost with a specific mineral used in media.  We provide results, data, consulting, and observations, but we do not endorse or promote specific products or companies.  The only thing we promote is science.

        <h2 class="copy-header">How We Do It</h2>
        <p class="copy-text">GRD’s one-of-a-kind stormwater laboratory is in Culpeper, VA.  The laboratory includes a closed-loop rain simulator, a weather station, and multiple outdoor green roof platforms.  These facilities allow us to monitor controlled and uncontrolled hydrologic cycles and biology.  Our team designs all our own tests and experiments, gleaning from previously established protocols for related technologies when relevant.
          <br>
          <br>
          Technology is integral to our operation.  (A high number of data points per test) * (high sample size) = massive amounts of data.  We have developed our own software to collect and analyze this data so that our team remains maximally agile, while ensuring the highest degree of consistency and data integrity.
